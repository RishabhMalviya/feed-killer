## LinkedIn Feed Removal
When you first open LinkedIn, it will remove the feed. If you navigate to another tab (like `Messages`), and then com back to `Home`, the feed will come back. This because LinkedIn is implemented as an SPA, and so navigating between tabs isn't equivalent to opening those URLs again. Anyway, I usually open LinkedIn to get a quick task done, and I need to remove the distractions the first time only.
