This is a Chrome Extension that currently does only one thing. When you first open LinkedIn, it will remove the feed. If you navigate to another tab (like `Messages`), and then com back to `Home`, the feed will come back. This is likely because LinkedIn is implemented as an SPA, and so navigating between tabs isn't equivalent to opening those URLs again.

Anyway, I usually open LinkedIn to get a quick task done, and I need to remove the distractions the first time only.

# How To Install
1. Clone this repo to some location on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/RishabhMalviya/feed-killer.git`.

3. That's it, you're good to go. Next time you open LinkedIn, the feed won't be there.
